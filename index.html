				<h3>Discover The Difference Of Visual Drag & Drop WordPress Websites</h3>
				<p>Divi is a game-changer, and when you first use it you will understand why. Building websites with the Visual Drag & Drop builder is unlike anything you have experienced before while creating WordPress websites. Divi lets anyone build beautiful websites with ease without having to code or install dozens of disjointed third party plugins.</p>

						<p>"Our firm has uses Divi as the base framework for over 40 client websites and we continue to use Divi on a regular basis due to the amazing flexibility that Divi provides our clients. As a web design firm we (Valorous Circle) can work with most any theme or design; we work with Divi because it saves us time and that translates into savings for our clients. Our clients love Divi because they have the ability to create amazing web page layouts using the Divi Page Builder without needing to understand the complexities of CSS, HTML or PHP. All of this combined with Elegant Theme's support and active user community make Divi and Elegant Themes a great choice for us and our clients."</p>

						<p>"We started our Small Business Initiative program to help Small Businesses get online in August 2013. When Divi was released in December 2013, it rapidly became our go-to template for all WordPress sites. During the past year, we have only had one client who wanted a different template. Divi is so easy to customize, that most clients can't even tell it's the Divi theme. Then, the builder is so easy for my clients to use, it's a snap to turn over to them to manage all their own content. And, they rarely mess it up. (However, it has happened, but Divi is so easy to admin, we can quickly hop online and adjust/fix any mistakes they've made. I am a huge fan. HUGE."</p>

						<h3>Andrew Palmer</h3>

						<img alt="Five Stars" src="https://cdn.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/images/45.jpg">
						<p>"After discovering Elegant Themes and using pretty much all of the themes on my client sites - it is clear to say that my business is built on Elegant Themes. Around 7 months ago, I discovered Divi and used my friend and client Pat Sharp as a test on Divi. Since then, I have transitioned around 40% of my clients to Divi and continue to beat the drum on the theme - its flexibility allows me and my developers to build a site in a few days rather than a few weeks and it offers everything a customer could need, out of the box mobile ready and if we do need to make amendments to the CSS to change the way it looks we can! Simply put, without Divi, I would not have a business and I cannot imagine using it on every site I build."</p>

			<h2 class="subhead">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<div class="faq_item">
				<h3>Why choose Elegant Themes?</h3>
				<p>ElegantThemes is a leader in WordPress development. We have been building WordPress Themes for 10 years and tend one of the largest customer bases of any company in the market. Our designs are beautiful, functional and affordable. With dozens of themes for $89, you are getting access to one of the largest collections of premium themes available for half the price that our competitors pay for a single theme!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="faq_item">
				<h3>Can I use the themes and plugins on multiple websites?</h3>
				<p>Yes, you are free to use our themes on as many websites as you like. We do not place any restrictions on how many times you can download or use a theme, nor do we limit the number of domains that you can install our themes to.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="faq_item">
				<h3>What if I change my mind and want a refund?</h3>
				<p>We offer no-questions-asked refunds to all customers within 30 days of your purchase. If you are not satisfied with our product, then simply send us an email and we will refund your purchase right away. Our goal has always been to create a happy, thriving community. If you are not thrilled with the product or are not enjoying the experience, then we have no interest in forcing you to stay an unhappy member.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="faq_item">
				<h3>Can I upgrade to a different package after signing up?</h3>
				<p>Yes, you can upgrade at any time after signing up. When you log in as a "personal" subscriber, you will see a notice regarding your current package and instructions on how to upgrade.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="faq_item">
				<h3>Can I use your themes on WordPress.com</h3>
				<p>Unfortunately WordPress.com does not allow the use of custom themes. If you would like to use a custom theme of any kind, you will need to purchase your own hosting account and install the free software from WordPress.org. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="faq_item">
				<h3>Can I use Elegant Themes products for my clients?</h3>
				<p>Yes, you are free to use our themes to build websites for your clients. We love providing developers with beautiful and functional design choices for their clients!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="faq_item">
				<h3>What happens if I cancel my subscription?</h3>
				<p>If you cancel your subscription, then your account will remain active for the remainder of your one year term. After that, you will lose access to the members area and all new themes, theme updates and tech support. You may continue using the themes that you have already downloaded forever.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="faq_item">
				<h3>Can I buy a single theme instead of joining the membership?</h3>
				<p>Our themes are only available as part of the membership. However, I think you will find that $89 is an incredible deal, even if you only intend to use a single theme from our collection. $89 is less than the price you would pay for a single theme at many other theme shops, and here you get access to a lot more!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="faq_item">
				<h3>Will your themes work with third party plugins?</h3>
				<p>While our themes should work fine with most plugins, there is no way for us to test and guarantee that all plugins will work. All we can guarantee is that our themes are coded excellently and that any plugin that also uses coding best practices should play well with our themes. If you run into any problems, let us know so that we can look into it. We also offer a 30-day money back guarantee just in case you discover that one of your third party plugins isn't working and you decide to use a different theme instead.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="faq_item">
				<h3>Do I need to install the Divi Builder plugin with the Divi Theme?</h3>
				<p>Nope, the Divi theme and the Extra theme both come with the Divi Builder packaged as part of the theme. There is no need to use the Divi Builder plugin if you are planning to use one of these two themes. If you ever decide to switch to a different theme after having built your website with Divi or Extra, the Divi Builder plugin can be installed so that you can continue to enjoy the power of the Divi Builder with your third party theme.</p>
